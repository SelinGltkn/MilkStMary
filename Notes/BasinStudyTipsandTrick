Forcing Data

  QA/QC
    1. Spatial map of monthly climatology
    2. Gridbox timeseries comparison against station data
    3.

Hydrology Modeling

Routing Nodes
  Match to as m

  QA/QC
    1. Spatial map of monthly climatology of water balance variables
      Soil moisture
      Baseflow
      Runoff
      Snow
      Others?
    2. Hydrographs of mean monthly flows for routed streamflow
    3.

Demands Modeling
  QA/QC
    1. Mean monthly NIR across scenarios


CRLE Modeling
  QA/QC
    1. Mean monthly reservoir evaporation across scenarios


RiverWare Modeling
  Naming convention
    1. File Name
    2. Model object names
  Model Settings
    1. Use environmental variable for project directory to allow models to be
      moved to other computers
    2. Model settings to check:
      a. MRM
        -Input DMI
        -Output DMI
        -Ruleset
      b. DMI
        -Control File
    3. Input and Output DMI

    4. Model Diagnostics
      a. Have a data object that can summarize model performance
        (perhaps two data objects; an annual and a monthly mean?)
        -Mean monthly streamflow at key locations
        -Mean annual diversion
        -Mean annual shortage
        -Mean monthly reservoir storage
        -Mean monthly reservoir inflow
        -Mean monthly reservoir outflow
        -Mean monthly hydropower production
      b. Have a second data object that can summarize NaN / NA values
        -Diversions
        -Shortages
        -Reservoir storage
        -Reservoir inflow
        -Reservoir outflow
        -Hydropower production
        -

RiverSmart
  Improvements
    a. Save run status independent of study file so that if RiverSmart crashes
      or is interrupted, the run status is preserved
    b. Last run date column in the Scenario Manager to see the last time a
      scenario was run
    c. The ability to name traces - instead of Trace 1, Trace 2 etc in the output,
      call them 'Historical', 'HD', 'LPP' etc.
